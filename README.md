Server-side scripting with Flask, JSON, and TMDB API. Created a web page that allows you to search for information regarding movies and TV shows using the TMDB API and the results will be displayed on cards below the search query. Upon clicking a button in the card, a modal will pop up and display more information about that selected movie/TV show. Creates XMLHttpRequests to the Flask server which in turn makes a request to the TMDB servers via the API and returns the data upon a successful response to be used to display in the web page.
